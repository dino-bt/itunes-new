Itunes searc engine instructions

In order to run this project succesfully 

click on search in the header section of the site 

this will direct you to the search engine

you can then type in the artist that you want to search fro eg. Jack Johnson and the type it in

then add movies to the dropdown list 

You will then be presented with a list of the movies 

once you find a movie you like you can click on the favourite button 

this will then store your movie in favourite component you can then 

choose to delete a specific component.

I have run tests on the site and everything seems to be working 

I have also added helmet for security breach reasons
